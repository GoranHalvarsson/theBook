#Table of Content

## Part One: Basics

### Section One: MVC
Note: I'm hesitant about including this section, since there is already a lot of content out there about MVC, but maybe someone is interested in write some content to introduce the MVC pattern, tailoring the content to help the reader better understand how ASP.NET MVC integrates with Sitecore?

#### Chapter 1: The MVC pattern

#### Chapter 2: ASP.NET MVC

### Section Two: MVC in Sitecore

#### Chapter 1: Back to Basics: Sitecore Items, Data Templates, Layouts and Renderings   

#### Chapter 2: Essential Tools 
- Sitecore Rocks

#### Chapter 3: The MVC pattern in Sitecore

#### Chapter 4: Setting up the project

#### Chapter 5: Create Your First MVC Project in Sitecore

#### Chapter 6: Sitecore.MVC
- Html.Sitecore()

#### Chapter 7: Renderings
- View Rendering
- Controller rendering

#### Chapter 8: Model Binding

#### Chapter 9: Helpers
- Extending the SitecoreHelper Class

#### Chapter 10: MVC Routes 

#### Chapter 11: Forms
Anything special here developer should know? 

#### Chapter 12: DMS
Is there anything specific to MVC that needs to be discussed?

#### Chapter 13: Page Editor

#### Chapter 14: Sitecore Item WebAPI

#### Chapter 15: Glass Mapper and some other third party stuff?

### Section Three: Case Studies
The more the merrier, obviously, but we should at least include a couple of case studies. Each case study should be accompanied by a fully working Visual Studio solution with all the files and resources needed.

### Section Four: References

#### Chapter 1: Online Resources
Anything else here?
